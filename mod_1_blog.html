    <h2>Will Ratterman's Module 1 Experience - 6/20/2017</h2>
    <p><span>Intro:</span> I would have to say that my Module 1 experience at Turing was a net positive experience by a long shot. It was not without its own difficulties (obviously, the program was designed to be difficult) but I think that the idea Turing has is to challenge students with tasks they understand most of, but requires them to independently research what else is needed. This is exactly where I see the value of this program existing, in it's ability to not only train coders the fundamentals of different languages (Ruby in Backend Engineering), but also train the ability to be flexible and self-reliant in an ever-changing industry like tech. The way I see it, the program can be roughly broken up into 3 sections: Instruction, Material, and Community</p>
    <p><span>Instructors:</span> I thought that the instruction I received at Turing was great. They Mod 1 instructors for cohort 1705 BEE were easily approachable with questions, friendly in their feedback, and took a 'let's figure it out' attitude rather than a traditional 'right or wrong'. I think this is where I may differ from some other students who felt like they would have benefited from more precise direction. I liked that the instructors were, in a helpful way, forcing me to answer my own questions. Turing doesn't necessarily teach you exactly what you need to know per se, but teaches you how to teach yourself. That previous sentence makes me cringe a little, because I feel it is worded in a way that implies that the instructors aren't very valuable which is not true. The instructors are great at correcting small mistakes, giving additional strategies to accomplish desired functionality, reccomending resources to look up additional strategies, and qeustioning the logic behind what we are trying to accomplish to help us gather a 'full-picture' approach. It is the decision on how to pursue it that they give to the students, and I love that. Two thumbs up!</p>
    <p><span>Material:</span> The material is definitely unique, as to be expected with the logic testing for applicants. It requires the ability to visualize what different objects in your code represent, and being able to manipulate them based on the type of object they are. It felt like building a puzzle. You have an end goal (ex. The Eiffel Tower), but you need to piece it together with 1,000 pieces. The only difference is you also have to build the pieces. It is challenging for sure, but if someone is the type of person who loves the process of thinking out and completing puzzles, as well as the mindset of a batter in baseball (if you only fuck up 70% of the time, you're a Hall of Famer) coding may be for you. I definitely think it is a skillset that can be developed, but the interest in the topic may be more dependent on the individual. I absolutely enjoyed it, but I can definitely understand why it isn't for everyone.</p>
    <p><span>Community:</span> This is where Turing really seperates itself in my opinion. The collectiveness of the Turing commuinty, staff and students both, is incredible. Not only is it great from a practical perspective (~20 students per mod * 8 active mods = ~160 + staff + alumni of communal networking with future/present people in tech), but also to create a great learning environment. As easy as it is to reach out and get help from an instructor, it is even easier to ask a student, any student, any question. Even if the point is just to have someone listen while you try and articulate your thought, your peers at Turing are not just willing, but eager to listen. After all, it is a learning opportunity for them as well. It just seems like the students can all bond over the difficulty of the program and use it as a shared similarity. In the same way that the head coach of a team may intentionally be an asshole to give the team a shared common enemy to expedite bonding and team comradery, the Turing students have an organic "us against the world" attitude that is intoxicating to be a part of. If you buy into the community the ROI can be huge. I am lucky to be a part of it. </p>
    <p><span>Summary:</span> Overall, I am very fond of the Turing program so far. It does take the willingness to try a different approach to learning than a lot of people are used to, myself include. Additionally, pairing that with the inherent difficulty and volume on information we are expected to learn can be intimidating. But if/when the student develops the self confidence than any problem they come across they will eventually figure out, they are cooking with gasoline. I am excited for Mod 2.</p>
