    <h2>Will Ratterman's Module 1 Experience</h2>
    <p><span>Intro:</span> Overall, I would have to say that my Module 1 experience at Turing was a net positive experience by a long shot. It was not without its own difficulties (obviously, the program was designed to be difficult) but I think that the idea Turing has is to challenge students with tasks they understand most of, but requires them to independently research what else is needed. This is exactly where I see the value of this program existing, in it's ability to not only train coders the fundamentals of different languages (Ruby in Backend Engineering), but also train the ability to be flexible and self-reliant in an ever-changing industry like tech. The way I see it, the program can be roughly broken up into 3 sections: Instruction, Material, and Community</p>
    <p><span>Instructors:</span> I thought that the instruction I received at Turing was great. They Mod 1 instructors for cohort 1705 BEE were easily approachable with questions, friendly in their feedback, and took a 'let's figure it out' attitude rather than a traditional 'right or wrong'. I think this is where I may differ from some other students who felt like they would have benefited from more precise direction. I liked that the instructors were, in a helpful way, forcing me to answer my own questions. Turing doesn't necessarily teach you exactly what you need to know per se, but teaches you how to teach yourself. That previous sentence makes me cringe a little, because I feel it is worded in a way that implies that the instructors aren't very valuable which is not true. The instructors are great at correcting small mistakes, giving additional strategies to accomplish desired functionality, reccomending resources to look up additional strategies, and qeustioning the logic behind what we are trying to accomplish to help us gather a 'full-picture' approach. It is the decision on how to pursue it that they give to the students, and I love that.</p>
